ok to begin here is an outline of what we need...

1. 1st off we need flags. 
flags will be used to detemrine if a building exists...
if a building exsits then we can make it so
check every 10 seconds if it exists.
if it does then a flag goes up for number of thay recourse building.
so then theres another flag. the flag for your recourses
how many of you have. 
the 1st flag i mentioned is for the number
of building. number of building determine if flag mumebr goes up or down.

2. now how do uou build the buildings in skirmish?
well you may build themarround your Town Center.
your town center is the center of your camp.
you can build other town Centers located theoughout the map.

everything needs a worker which is why you need town centers.
they build stuff.

now how do you make it so so you can build on the pads arround the center?
lua code. you build that and its like a metric system
where you build and you get position of that onject.
then it spawns depending on the faction your build pad.
where you can build what you want on it.

ok now were going to talk about God Powers.
its quite Simple... we can simulate them using abilities
for example for a plague we cna spawn a unit whcih then after 5 seconds will die.
thus you get it.

ok now how do units work? so each barracks has its own
Multiplayer stuff.
so like ships dont come from space... so instead when you build it,
it makes it so it spawns a unit instead at pre determined markers...
