ok to begin here is an outline of what we need...

1. 1st off we need flags. 
flags will be used to detemrine if a building exists...
if a building exsits then we can make it so
check every 10 seconds if it exists.
if it does then a flag goes up for number of thay recourse building.
so then theres another flag. the flag for your recourses
how many of you have. 
the 1st flag i mentioned is for the number
of building. number of building determine if flag mumebr goes up or down.

2. now how do uou build the buildings in skirmish?
well you may build themarround your Town Center.
your town center is the center of your camp.
you can build other town Centers located theoughout the map.

everything needs a worker which is why you need town centers.
they build stuff.

now how do you make it so so you can build on the pads arround the center?
lua code. you build that and its like a metric system
where you build and you get position of that onject.
then it spawns depending on the faction your build pad.
where you can build what you want on it.

ok now were going to talk about God Powers.
its quite Simple... we can simulate them using abilities
for example for a plague we cna spawn a unit whcih then after 5 seconds will die.
thus you get it.

ok now how do units work? so each barracks has its own
Multiplayer stuff.
so like ships dont come from space... so instead when you build it,
it makes it so it spawns a unit instead at pre determined markers...


ok Xml Code... 
STORY_CONSTRUCT¶

Parameter 1: Unit type (multiple possible for 'or' condition)
Parameter 2: Number (multiple possible but broken for any but the first (will use either 1 if not set or the first number))
Parameter 3: Filter
Multiple unit types can be set (whitespace separated), however the counting behaves strangely. The event will trigger if the given number of units of the first type is built or one unit of the other types.

STORY_DESTROY¶

Parameter 1: Unit type
Parameter 2: Planet
Parameter 3: Number
Parameter 4: Filter
Multiple values for the parameters should be possible but at least for parameter 3 it doesn't look like it works correctly.


ok so the Lua code we might need...

Xml Event Manipulation¶

Function	Parameters	Usage
Story_Event(X,Y)	X = string, Y = game object(optional)	Trigger a STORY_AI_NOTIFICATION event
Check_Story_Flag(X,Y,Z,U)	X = player, Y = string, Z = game object, U = bool	Checks if corresponding reward type TRIGGER_AI has fired. The final parameter causes the flag to be reset if set to true.
Get_Story_Plot(X)	X = string (story_file_name.xml)	Returns the story file as StoryPlotWrapper object. The parameter is case sensitive.
StoryPlotWrapper Functions¶

Function	Parameters	Usage
.Get_Event(X)	X = string(Event name)	Returns the xml event as StoryEventWrapper object.
.Suspend()	-	Suspends the plot
.Activate()	-	Activates the plot
.Reset()	-	Resets all events of the plot
StoryEventWrapper Functions¶

Function	Parameters	Usage
.Set_Reward_Type(X)	X = string(reward type)	-
.Set_Reward_Parameter(X,Y)	X = number, Y = something that makes sense	Sets Reward_Param(X+1) as Y (X is 0 for Reward_Param1). Unlike Set_Event_Parameter this command cannot take more than 2 parameters.
.Set_Event_Parameter(X, Y, ...)	X = number, Y = something that makes sense	Sets Event_Param(X+1) as Y (X is 0 for Event_Param1). Can take more than 2 parameters to set e.g. multiple object types for a single event parameter.
.Set_Dialog(X)	X = string(dialog file name)	Sets the dialog file.
.Clear_Dialog_Text()	-	-
.Add_Dialog_Text(X,...)	X = string(text identifier from dat file)	The text will be formatted with any additional parameters given.
PositionWrapper Functions¶

Function	Parameters	Usage
.Get_XYZ()	-	Returns the three coordinate values of the position. Only exists in steam version since the Hanuary 2021 patch.

Lua code outline wjtb what we got...


Check_Story_Flag(X,Y,Z,U)	X = player, Y = string, Z = game object, U = bool	Checks if corresponding reward type TRIGGER_AI has fired. The final parameter causes the flag to be reset if set to true.
